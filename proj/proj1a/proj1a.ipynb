In part 2 of this project you will be building a linear model that predict sales prices using training data but it's important to first understand how the structure of the data informs such a model.

Since `Roof Material` is a categorical variable, we will have to one-hot-encode the data.  Notice in the example code below that we have to pre-specify the categories. For more information on categorical data in pandas, refer to this [link](https://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/user_guide/categorical.html). For more information on why we want to use one-hot-encoding, refer to this [link](https://machinelearningmastery.com/why-one-hot-encode-data-in-machine-learning/).\n",

    "**Note**: You should **avoid using `pd.get_dummies`** in your solution as it will remove your original column and is therefore not as reusable as your constructed data preprocessing pipeline.

You will be well-prepared to build such a model: you have considered what is in this data set, what it can be used for, and engineered some features that should be useful for prediction. Creating a house-pricing model for Cook County has some challenging social implications to think, though, however. This will be addressed in an upcoming lecture and next week's discussion."
