    "### 3. A suggested workflow for writing SQL in Jupyter Notebooks\n",

    "Which approach is better, `%sql` magic or `pd.read_sql`?\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL database generally contains much more data than what you would analyze in detail. As a Python-fluent data scientist, you will often query SQL databases to perform initial exploratory data analysis, a subset of which you load into Python for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, you would likely use a combination of the two approaches. First, you'd try out some SQL queries with `%sql` magic to get an interesting subset of data. Then, you'd copy over the query into a `pd.read_sql` command for visualization, modeling, and export with Pandas, sklearn, and other Python libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "For SQL assignments in this course, to minimize unruly error messages while maximizing Python compatibility, we suggest the following \"sandboxed\" workflow:\n",
    "1. Create a `%%sql` magic cell **below** the answer cell. You can copy in the below code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    %% sql\n",
    "    -- This is a comment. Put your code here... --\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Work on the SQL query in the `%%sql` cell; e.g., `SELECT ... ;`\n",
    "1. Then, once you're satisfied with your SQL query, copy it into the multi-string query in the answer cell (the one that contains the `pd.read_sql` call).\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to follow the above workflow to get full credit on assignments, but we suggest it to reduce debugging headaches. We've created the scratchwork `%%sql` cells for you in this assignment, but **do not** add cells between this `%%sql` cell and the Python cell right below it. It will cause errors when we run the autograder, and it will sometimes cause a failure to generate the PDF file.\n"
