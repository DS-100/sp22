However, one of the disadvantages in directly translating to a numeric value is that we unintentionally assign certain features disproportionate weight. Consider assigning Sunday to the numeric value of 7, and Monday to the numeric value of 1. In our linear model, Sunday will have 7 times the influence of Monday, which can lower the accuracy of our model.\n",

This dataframe holds our \"featurized\" data, which is also often denoted by $\\phi$.\n",
