This allows us to use more data for training instead of having to set aside some specifically for hyperparameter selection. However, doing so requires more computation resources as we'll have to fit K models per hyperparameter choice.\n",

To select between various features, various models, or various hyperparameters, we split the training set further into multiple temporary train and validation sets (each split is called a \"fold\", hence k-fold cross validation). We will use the average validation error across all k folds to make our optimal feature, model, and hyperparameter choices. In this example, we'll only use this procedure for hyperparameter selection, specifically to choose the best alpha."
