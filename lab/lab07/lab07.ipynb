    "In this lab, we will review some of the details of how linear regression works as described in Lectures 12 and 13.\n",

    "We will also show you how to do linear regression using various real world tools including:\n",

    "In real world data science work, you are far more likely to use something similar to the `seaborn` and `scikit-learn` approaches, but it is important to know how to use the formulaic and `scipy.optimize` approaches so that you understand what is really going on.\n",

    "In the previous parts we showed how to establish relationships between one independent explanatory variable and one response variable. However, with real-world problems you will often want to use **multiple features** to model and predict a response variable. To do so, we will use multiple linear regression, as discussed in [Lecture 13](http://ds100.org/sp21/lecture/lec13/). Multiple linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two or more explanatory variables and a response variable by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. Formally, the model for multiple linear regression, given $p$ features is:\n",

Usually “features” are used in the context of machine learning when you are trying to make predictions. “Independent variables” and “explanatory variables” are mainly found in statistics, econometrics and other related fields which focus on understanding the relationship between a set of variables.  \n",
