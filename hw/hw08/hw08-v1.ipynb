    "- Training a different linear regression model for every possible combination of categorical variables can overfit. How would you select which variables to include in a decision tree instead of just using them all?\n",
    "- Your models use the observed distance as an input, but the distance is only observed after the ride is over. How could you estimate the distance from the pick-up and drop-off locations?\n",
