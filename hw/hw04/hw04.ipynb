    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Bike sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the process of signing up, renting and returning is automated. Through these systems, users are able to easily rent a bike from one location and return them to another. We will be analyzing bike sharing data from Washington D.C. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will perform tasks to clean, visualize, and explore the bike sharing data. You will also investigate open-ended questions. These open-ended questions ask you to think critically about how the plots you have created provide insight into the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this assignment, you should be comfortable with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* reading plaintext delimited data into `pandas`\n",
    "* wrangling data for analysis\n",
    "* using EDA to learn about your data \n",
    "* making informative plots\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "Grading is broken down into autograded answers and free response. \n",
    "\n",
    "For autograded answers, the results of your code are compared to provided and/or hidden tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "For free response, readers will evaluate how well you answered the question and/or fulfilled the requirements of the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "For plots, your plots should be *similar* to the given examples. We will tolerate small variations such as color differences or slight variations in scale. However it is in your best interest to make the plots as similar as possible, as similarity is subject to the readers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that for ALL plotting questions from here on out, we will expect appropriate titles, axis labels, legends, etc. The following question serves as a good guideline on what is \"enough\": If I directly downloaded the plot and viewed it, would I be able to tell what was being visualized without knowing the question?** \n",
