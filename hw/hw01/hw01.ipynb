In this course, we will prove your findings using a generalization of your calculation in the previous question.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we get to this proof later in this course, you will need to be comfortable with vector operations. For now, you will get familiar with this notation by rewriting your least squares findings from Data 8 (and the previous question) using vector notation. **This question won't require you to write LaTeX**, so just focus on the mathematical notation we're presenting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dot Product\n",
    "(1) We start by defining the **dot product** of two *real* vectors\n",
    "$x = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "     x_1 \\\\\n",
    "     x_2 \\\\\n",
    "     \\dots \\\\\n",
    "     x_n\n",
    "     \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "and \n",
    "$y = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "     y_1 \\\\\n",
    "     y_2 \\\\\n",
    "     \\dots \\\\\n",
    "     y_n\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x^T y = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i $$\n",
    "* Given the above definition, the dot product is (1) a **scalar**, not another vector; and (2) only defined for two vectors of the same length.\n",
    "* **Note**: In this course we often opt for $x$ instead of $\\vec{x}$ to simplify notation; $x$ as a vector is inferred from its use in the dot product. Then $x_i$ is the $i$-th element of the vector $x$.\n",
    "* *Detail*: In this course, we prefer the notation $x^Ty$ to illustrate a dot product, defined as matrix multiplication of $x^T$ and $y$. In the literature you may also see $x \\cdot y$, but we avoid this notation since the dot ($\\cdot$) notation is occasionally used for scalar values.\n",
    "* *Detail*: The dot product is a special case of an inner product, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) We introduce a special vector, $\\mathbb{1}$, to write the [**mean**](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/14/1/Properties_of_the_Mean.html) $\\bar{x}$ of data $(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n)$ as a dot product:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\bar{x} &= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n 1x_i \\\\\n",
    "        &= \\frac{1}{n}(x^T\\mathbb{1}).\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "* The data $(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ have been defined as an $n$-dimensional column vector $x$, where $x = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "     x_1 \\\\\n",
    "     x_2 \\\\\n",
    "     \\dots \\\\\n",
    "     x_n\n",
    "     \\end{bmatrix}$.\n",
    "* The special vector $\\mathbb{1}$ is a **vector of ones**, whose length is defined by the vector operation in which it is used. So with $n$-dimensional column vector $x$, the dot product $x^T\\mathbb{1}$ implies that $\\mathbb{1}$ is an $n$-dimensional column vector where every element is $1$.\n",
    "* Because dot products produce scalars, the multiplication of two scalars $\\frac{1}{n}$ and $x^T\\mathbb{1}$ produces another scalar, $\\bar{x}$.\n",
    "* **Note**: We use bar notation for the mean ($\\bar{x}$ instead of $\\mu$) in this problem to differentiate $\\bar{x}$ from $\\bar{y}$, the latter of which is the mean of data $(y_1, \\dots, y_n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) We can further use this definition of $\\bar{x}$ to additionally write the [**variance**](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/14/2/Variability.html#The-Rough-Size-of-Deviations-from-Average) $\\sigma_x^2$ of the data $(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ as a dot product. Verify for yourself that the below operation defines $\\sigma_x^2$ as a scalar:\n",
