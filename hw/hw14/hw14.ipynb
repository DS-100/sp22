Tree regression made better use of categorical variables than linear regression. The domain knowledge that duration is a simple function of distance and speed allowed you to predict duration more accurately by first predicting speed.\n",

    "- The regression model would have been more accurate if we had used the date itself as a feature instead of just the day of the week. Why didn't we do that?\n",
    "- Does collecting this information about every taxi ride introduce a privacy risk? The original data also included the total fare; how could someone use this information combined with an individual's credit card records to determine their location?\n",
    "- Why did we treat `hour` as a categorical variable instead of a quantitative variable? Would a similar treatment be beneficial for latitude and longitude?\n",
    "- Why are Google Maps estimates of ride time much more accurate than our estimates?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some possible extensions to the assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An alternative to throwing out atypical days is to condition on a feature that makes them atypical, such as the weather or holiday calendar. How would you do that?\n",
    "- Training a different linear regression model for every possible combination of categorical variables can overfit. How would you select which variables to include in a decision tree instead of just using them all?\n",
    "- Your models use the observed distance as an input, but the distance is only observed after the ride is over. How could you estimate the distance from the pick-up and drop-off locations?\n",
    "- How would you incorporate traffic data into the model?"
